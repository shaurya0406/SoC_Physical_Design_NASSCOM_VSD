# Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning
This course is designed to guide participants through the entire process of SoC design, from the RTL netlist to the final tape-out. Using the open-source `130nm Google-SkyWater PDK` and `Openlane` flow, one will gain hands-on experience with industry-standard tools like `Yosys`, `OpenLANE`, `NGSpice`, `Magic`, and `OpenSTA`. The course emphasizes practical, chip tapeout-oriented learning, providing participants with real-life design experience and a comprehensive understanding of the automated `RTL2GDSII` process. With a focus on `RISC-V` architecture, standard cell design, and timing analysis, this course equips you with the skills necessary to succeed in modern IC design and fabrication.

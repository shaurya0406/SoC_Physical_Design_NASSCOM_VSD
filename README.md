### Part 1: Introduction to OpenLANE and the Flow.tcl Script

This section introduces you to the OpenLANE flow, its purpose, and how it automates the RTL-to-GDSII flow. We will also dive into the `flow.tcl` script, which is a key component in running the OpenLANE flow, and discuss the differences between interactive and non-interactive sessions, as well as the initial steps required to set up the environment.

---

#### **1. Overview of OpenLANE**

**OpenLANE** is an open-source flow designed to facilitate the process of converting a Register Transfer Level (RTL) design into a final GDSII layout, which is ready for tape-out. The flow is designed to be automated, modular, and reusable, making it easier for designers to work through the complex stages of physical design.

- **Purpose**: The primary goal of OpenLANE is to provide a completely open-source, end-to-end ASIC design flow that integrates multiple open-source tools. This includes tools for synthesis, placement, routing, and other necessary stages in the RTL-to-GDSII process.

- **Key Tools Used**:
  - **Yosys**: For logic synthesis.
  - **ABC**: For technology mapping.
  - **OpenSTA**: For Static Timing Analysis (STA).
  - **Magic**: For layout generation and DRC.
  - **Klayout**: For layout viewing and further checks.
  - **Netgen**: For LVS (Layout vs. Schematic) checking.
  - **OpenROAD**: For place and route.
  - **OpenPhySyn**: For physical synthesis optimizations.

- **Flow Steps**: OpenLANE breaks down the design process into several stages:
  1. **Preparation**: Setting up the environment and merging libraries.
  2. **Synthesis**: Converting the RTL code into a gate-level netlist.

  6. **Routing**: Connecting all the placed cells with wires.
  7. **Signoff**: Performing final checks, including DRC, LVS, and timing analysis.

---

#### **2. Flow.tcl Script**

The `flow.tcl` script is the backbone of the OpenLANE flow. It is used to run the entire flow in a sequential manner or interactively, depending on the user's requirements.

- **Script Location**: The `flow.tcl` script is located in the root directory of the OpenLANE flow. It is the primary script that orchestrates the entire design flow by calling various tools and scripts in a defined order.

- **Modes of Operation**:
  - **Interactive Mode**: The user can execute each step of the flow manually, providing more control and the ability to analyze results after each step.
  - **Non-Interactive Mode**: The entire flow runs automatically from start to finish with minimal user intervention. This mode is useful for running the entire design flow in a batch process.

- **Command Structure**:
  - In **interactive mode**, the user runs the `flow.tcl` script with the `-interactive` flag:
    ```bash
    ./flow.tcl -interactive
    ```
  - Once in interactive mode, commands can be issued step by step, such as:
    ```bash
    prep design <design_name>
    run_synthesis
    ```
  - In **non-interactive mode**, the flow runs from start to finish using a single command:
    ```bash
    ./flow.tcl -design <design_name>
    ```

- **Key Steps in the Script**:
  1. **Preparation (`prep`)**: The script sets up the environment and merges the required technology libraries, such as LEF (Library Exchange Format) files.
  2. **Synthesis (`run_synthesis`)**: Executes the Yosys synthesis tool to generate a gate-level netlist.
  3. **Floorplanning (`run_floorplan`)**: Runs the floorplanning step, defining the physical dimensions and layout of the chip.
  4. **Placement (`run_placement`)**: Places the synthesized cells onto the defined floorplan.
  5. **CTS (`run_cts`)**: Synthesizes the clock tree, ensuring proper clock distribution across the design.
  6. **Routing (`run_routing`)**: Connects the cells using metal layers to form the complete design.
  7. **Signoff (`run_signoff`)**: Runs final checks like DRC and LVS before the design is taped out.

- **Flexibility and Customization**:
  - The `flow.tcl` script allows for significant flexibility, as users can modify and add new commands depending on the design requirements. 
  - Configuration files can be edited to change the flow's behavior, such as adjusting utilization rates or modifying clock constraints.
  
- **Command Logging**:
  - All commands executed during the flow are logged in a `commands.log` file within the `runs` directory, providing a complete record of the flow for debugging and review.

### Part 2: Setting Up the OpenLANE Environment and Running the Initial Steps

In this part, we'll dive into the process of setting up the OpenLANE environment and the initial steps required to begin working with a specific design. This includes cloning the necessary repositories, setting up the Process Design Kit (PDK), and understanding the significance of different design configuration files. We will also walk through the process of running the `flow.tcl` script in interactive mode, and discuss the importance of each step in the early stages of the design flow.

---

#### **1. Setting Up the Environment**

Before you can start working with OpenLANE, you need to set up your environment properly. This involves installing the necessary tools, cloning the required repositories, and configuring the Process Design Kit (PDK).

- **Cloning the Repositories**:
  - The first step is to clone the OpenLANE repository from GitHub, which contains all the scripts and tools needed for the flow.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane.git
    ```
  - After cloning the repository, you must also clone the PDK repository, typically the SkyWater 130nm PDK, which includes all the design rules and libraries needed for the specific process technology.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk.git
    ```
  - These repositories provide all the necessary components to start the design process.

- **Setting Up the PDK**:
  - The Process Design Kit (PDK) is crucial as it contains the physical design rules and standard cell libraries for the process node youâ€™re targeting (e.g., SkyWater 130nm).
  - In the OpenLANE environment, the PDK setup involves integrating these libraries with the design tools in a manner that allows the tools to use them during synthesis, placement, routing, and other steps.
  - To set up the PDK within OpenLANE, navigate to the `OpenLane` directory and run the following command:
    ```bash
    make mount
    ```
  - This command mounts the PDK and tools into a Docker container, ensuring that the environment is isolated and properly configured.

- **Checking the Environment**:
  - Once the PDK is set up, itâ€™s important to ensure that the environment is correctly configured. This can be done by running:
    ```bash
    ./flow.tcl -interactive
    ```
  - If the environment is correctly set up, the interactive session will start without any errors, and youâ€™ll be ready to run the design flow.

---

#### **2. Understanding the Configuration Files**

The OpenLANE flow relies heavily on various configuration files that define how the flow should behave for a specific design. Understanding these files is critical for controlling the design process.

- **Configuring `config.tcl`**:
  - The `config.tcl` file is the main configuration file that controls the behavior of the flow for a specific design.
  - It includes parameters such as the target frequency, synthesis strategy, placement density, and routing strategies.
  - Users can edit this file to fine-tune the flow according to the needs of their design. For example, you might want to change the target clock period to meet specific timing requirements:
    ```tcl
    set ::env(CLOCK_PERIOD) "10"
    ```
  - Other important parameters include utilization factors, which control the density of the cells in the design, and various tool-specific options that can affect the synthesis, placement, and routing outcomes.

- **Merging LEF Files**:
  - LEF (Library Exchange Format) files describe the physical dimensions and pin placements of standard cells and macros.
  - During the setup process, these LEF files are merged to create a complete view of all the cells and blocks that will be used in the design. This merging process is critical to ensure that the placement and routing tools have the necessary information to work with the standard cells.
  - The LEF files are typically merged in the preparation step using:
    ```bash
    prep -design <design_name>
    ```
  - This command prepares the design by merging the required LEF files and setting up the design environment.

- **Design-Specific Settings**:
  - The `config.tcl` file is not the only place where configurations are stored. Each design might have specific settings files that further control how the flow behaves.
  - For example, `sky130A_sram_1kbyte_1rw1r_32x256_8.v` might define the specific SRAM configuration used in a design, ensuring that the correct memory models are used during simulation and synthesis.

---

#### **3. Running the Initial Steps in Interactive Mode**

After setting up the environment and configuring the design, the next step is to run the initial stages of the flow. These stages include design preparation, synthesis, and floorplanning.

- **Starting the Interactive Session**:
  - Begin by launching the interactive session:
    ```bash
    ./flow.tcl -interactive
    ```
  - This opens a prompt where you can enter commands to run each step of the flow manually.

- **Preparation (`prep`)**:
  - The first command to run is the preparation step:
    ```bash
    prep -design <design_name>
    ```
  - This command prepares the design environment by merging the LEF files, setting up the necessary directories, and preparing the configuration files.
  - The preparation step also involves setting up the `runs` directory, where all the output files will be stored. Each run generates a timestamped folder under `runs`, which contains subdirectories for temporary files, results, reports, and logs.

- **Synthesis (`run_synthesis`)**:
  - After preparation, the next step is to run synthesis:
    ```bash
    run_synthesis
    ```
  - This command invokes Yosys and ABC to convert the RTL code into a gate-level netlist.
  - The synthesis step is critical as it determines the quality of the netlist, which directly impacts the subsequent steps like placement and routing.
  - The output of the synthesis step includes a synthesized netlist and reports on timing, area, and other critical metrics.

- **Floorplanning (`run_floorplan`)**:
  - The next command is to run floorplanning:
    ```bash
    run_floorplan
    ```
  - Floorplanning defines the chipâ€™s size, shape, and placement of key components such as macros and I/O pins.
  - The outcome of the floorplanning step is a layout with defined regions for standard cells and macros, which serves as the foundation for the placement and routing stages.

- **Importance of Order**:
  - It is crucial to run these steps in the correct order because each step depends on the output of the previous one. For instance, if you skip the synthesis step and try to run floorplanning, the command will fail because the required netlist is missing.

---

### Part 3: The `runs` Directory and Folder Structures

The `runs` directory and its associated folder structures play a crucial role in the OpenLANE flow. This part will provide a detailed explanation of the `runs` directory, the purpose of its subdirectories, and the contents generated during the design process. We'll cover the significance of each folder and how they contribute to managing and organizing the results of the design flow.

---

#### **1. Overview of the `runs` Directory**

When you start the OpenLANE flow, one of the first things the toolchain does is create a `runs` directory. This directory serves as a central repository for all the outputs generated during the design process. Each time you execute a flow, a new timestamped folder is created within the `runs` directory. This allows you to easily manage and reference the results of different design runs.

- **Timestamped Folder Creation**:
  - Each run creates a unique folder within the `runs` directory, named with the date and time of the run. This timestamped folder helps in distinguishing between multiple runs, making it easier to track the evolution of your design.
  - For example, a typical folder name might be something like `2024-08-25_14-30-00`, indicating the run started on August 25, 2024, at 2:30 PM.
  - This naming convention ensures that you can easily identify and access the results of specific runs without confusion.

---

#### **2. Subdirectories within the Timestamped Folder**

Each timestamped folder within the `runs` directory contains several important subdirectories. These subdirectories are organized to store different types of files generated at various stages of the design flow. Understanding the purpose of each subdirectory is essential for navigating the results of your design process.

- **1. `tmp` Directory**:
  - **Purpose**: The `tmp` directory is used to store temporary files generated during the design flow. These files are typically intermediate files that are necessary for the flow but may not be needed after the flow is complete.
  - **Contents**: This directory might include files such as intermediate netlists, temporary timing analysis reports, or logs from individual steps.
  - **Usage**: While these files are usually not critical for final analysis, they can be useful for debugging purposes or understanding the flow's behavior at a granular level.

- **2. `results` Directory**:
  - **Purpose**: The `results` directory is where the final output files from each step of the design flow are stored. These files represent the culmination of each stage, such as synthesized netlists, floorplans, and final GDSII files.
  - **Contents**: This directory is further divided into subfolders corresponding to each stage of the design flow, such as `synthesis`, `floorplan`, `placement`, `routing`, etc.
    - For example, after the synthesis step, the `results/synthesis` folder will contain the synthesized netlist and associated reports.
    - After the final step in the flow, the `results/routing` folder might contain the GDSII file, which is the final layout that can be sent for fabrication.
  - **Usage**: This directory is critical for reviewing the final outcomes of the flow. It allows you to examine the key deliverables of each stage, such as checking the quality of the netlist, the efficiency of the floorplan, or the correctness of the final layout.

- **3. `reports` Directory**:
  - **Purpose**: The `reports` directory stores all the reports generated during the flow, including timing analysis, area reports, power estimates, and more.
  - **Contents**: Similar to the `results` directory, this directory is divided into subfolders for each stage of the design flow. Each subfolder contains reports relevant to that particular stage.
    - For example, the `reports/synthesis` folder might include reports on the number of cells, the area utilization, and the critical path timing after synthesis.
    - The `reports/routing` folder might include detailed routing congestion reports or post-route timing analysis.
  - **Usage**: Reports are essential for evaluating the performance and quality of your design at each stage. They provide insights into how well the design meets its objectives, such as timing closure, area constraints, and power consumption.

- **4. `logs` Directory**:
  - **Purpose**: The `logs` directory contains log files for each step of the design flow. These logs record the commands executed, tool outputs, and any warnings or errors encountered during the run.
  - **Contents**: Like the other directories, `logs` is divided into subfolders for each stage of the design flow. Each subfolder contains log files that document the actions taken during that stage.
    - For instance, the `logs/synthesis` folder might contain a detailed log of the synthesis process, including the commands executed by Yosys and ABC, as well as any messages generated during the process.
    - The `logs/routing` folder might include logs from the detailed routing step, capturing the actions of the OpenROAD tools.
  - **Usage**: The logs are invaluable for debugging and understanding the behavior of the flow. If a step fails or produces unexpected results, the log files are the first place to look for clues about what went wrong.

---

#### **3. Key Files within the `runs` Directory**

Aside from the main subdirectories, the `runs` directory also contains several key files that provide additional information about the flow and its configuration.

- **1. `config.optical` File**:
  - **Purpose**: This file contains a snapshot of the configuration options used during the run. It records the parameters set in the `config.tcl` file and any modifications made during the interactive session.
  - **Contents**: The file lists all the environment variables and settings that were active during the run, including clock constraints, synthesis options, and placement density targets.
  - **Usage**: The `config.optical` file is useful for reviewing the exact configuration used in a particular run. If you need to replicate a successful run or understand the differences between runs, this file provides the necessary details.

- **2. `commands` File**:
  - **Purpose**: This file logs all the commands executed during the interactive session or automated flow. It provides a sequential record of the steps taken during the run.
  - **Contents**: The file includes every command executed, from design preparation to the final routing step. It captures the order of operations and any arguments passed to the commands.
  - **Usage**: The `commands` file is essential for tracing the flow of the design process. If you need to audit the steps taken during a run or replicate the flow, this file provides a detailed roadmap of the process.

### Part 4: Running Synthesis

#### **Overview of the Synthesis Step**

Synthesis is a crucial step in the RTL-to-GDSII flow where the high-level RTL (Register Transfer Level) description of the design is converted into a gate-level netlist. This process involves transforming the RTL code, written in hardware description languages like Verilog or VHDL, into a netlist consisting of logic gates and flip-flops that can be used for physical design. The synthesis process ensures that the design meets the specified functional and timing requirements.

#### **Understanding the Synthesis Command**

In OpenLANE, synthesis is initiated through the interactive mode or through specific commands in a non-interactive mode. Here's a breakdown of the synthesis process:

1. **Initiating Synthesis:**
   - In an interactive session, after preparing the design, you run the synthesis step using the command:
     ```tcl
     run_synthesis
     ```
   - This command triggers the synthesis process, which includes various tools and scripts to convert RTL code into a gate-level netlist.

2. **Synthesis Tools Involved:**
   - **Yosys:** An open-source synthesis tool that performs RTL synthesis. It processes the RTL code and generates an intermediate representation.
   - **ABC:** A tool used for technology mapping and logic optimization. It optimizes the netlist generated by Yosys to meet timing and area constraints.

3. **Files Generated During Synthesis:**
   - **Netlist Files:** The primary output is the gate-level netlist, which is used in subsequent steps. This file is usually stored in the `results` directory under a folder named `synthesis`.
   - **Synthesis Reports:** Reports detailing the synthesis results, including area, timing, and resource utilization, are generated and stored in the `reports` directory.

#### **Detailed Steps in the Synthesis Process**

1. **Preparation:**
   - Before running synthesis, ensure that the design environment is properly set up. This includes verifying that all necessary files and configurations are in place. The `design` folder should contain the RTL source files, configuration files, and any other required inputs.

2. **Running Synthesis:**
   - In an interactive OpenLANE session, you might run the following commands:
     ```tcl
     source flow.tcl
     run_synthesis
     ```
   - This command will start the synthesis process. During this step, the toolchain will perform the following tasks:
     - **RTL Parsing:** Yosys parses the RTL code to create an internal representation.
     - **Optimization:** Yosys performs initial optimizations on the RTL code.
     - **Mapping:** ABC maps the optimized RTL representation to technology-specific cells.
     - **Optimization and Mapping:** ABC further optimizes the design and maps it to the target technology's standard cell library.

3. **Monitoring the Synthesis Process:**
   - As synthesis progresses, monitor the OpenLANE logs for any errors or warnings. The logs can be found in the `logs` directory within the timestamped folder. Check these logs to ensure that the synthesis is proceeding as expected and to troubleshoot any issues that arise.

4. **Reviewing Synthesis Output:**
   - Once synthesis is complete, review the following files and reports:
     - **Netlist Files:** Located in the `results/synthesis` folder. These files represent the gate-level netlist.
     - **Synthesis Reports:** Found in the `reports/synthesis` folder. These reports include details such as the total area of the synthesized design, the number of cells used, and timing information.

#### **Post-Synthesis Analysis**

1. **Analyzing Synthesis Reports:**
   - Examine the synthesis report to understand the quality of the synthesis. Key metrics include:
     - **Area:** The total area occupied by the synthesized design.
     - **Cell Count:** The number of cells used in the design.
     - **Timing:** The critical path delay and other timing constraints.
   - Compare these metrics against the design specifications to ensure that the design meets the requirements.

2. **Flop Ratio Calculation:**
   - One of the first tasks after synthesis is to calculate the Flop Ratio. 
   - The Flop Ratio is a metric used to evaluate the utilization of flip-flops in your design.
   - It is calculated as the ratio of the number of D flip-flops to the total number of cells in the design.

    **Formula for Flop Ratio**

    To calculate the Flop Ratio, use the following formula:

    $$ \text{Flop Ratio} = \frac{\text{Number of D Flip-Flops}}{\text{Total Number of Cells}} $$

    **Example Calculation**

    Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to calculating the Flop Ratio using an example:

    1. **Obtain the Number of D Flip-Flops:**
    - This information is typically found in the synthesis report under the section detailing flip-flop counts.
    - **Example:** Number of D flip-flops = 1634

    2. **Obtain the Total Number of Cells:**
    - This can be found in the same synthesis report, under cell counts.
    - **Example:** Total number of cells = 17323

    3. **Perform the Calculation:**
    - Substitute the values into the formula:
        
    $$ \text{Flop Ratio} = \frac{1634}{17323} \approx 0.094 $$

    - Convert to percentage:

    $$ \text{Flop Ratio (Percentage)} = 0.094 \times 100 \approx 9.4\% $$

    4. **Interpreting the Result:**
    - A Flop Ratio of 9.4% indicates that 9.4% of the total cell count is comprised of D flip-flops.
    - **Importance:** A higher Flop Ratio can suggest more complex state management in the design, which might impact timing and area.

    5. **Importance of Flop Ratio**

    - **Design Efficiency:** Helps in evaluating how efficiently flip-flops are used in the design.
    - **Performance:** Affects the timing and performance of the design, as flip-flops are critical for synchronous operation.
    - **Optimization:** Provides insights into potential areas for optimization to reduce the number of flip-flops if necessary.


3. **Reviewing the Synthesized Netlist:**
   - Open the netlist files generated in the `results/synthesis` folder. Verify that the netlist accurately represents the RTL design and that all components are correctly mapped.

4. **Troubleshooting:**
   - If there are issues or discrepancies in the synthesized netlist or reports, revisit the RTL code and configuration files. Ensure that the design constraints and parameters are correctly specified.

## My Setup on Mac M2 Pro
- I have installed a `Ubuntu 22.04.02` Virtual Machine using [Parallels Desktop](https://www.parallels.com) (Will try to setup OpenLane directly on Mac later)
- Cloned OpenLane Github Repo and installed necessary requirements.

### Installation of required packages
Update packages database and upgrade the packages to avoid version mismatches then install required packages.
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt install -y build-essential python3 python3-venv make git
```
### Docker Installation
Docker is required to run OpenLane because it ensures a consistent, isolated, and reproducible environment, simplifies the setup process, provides portability across different operating systems, allows easy version control, enhances security, and facilitates collaboration. By using Docker, developers can focus on the design process without worrying about the complexities of setting up and managing the underlying toolchain and dependencies
```bash
# Remove old installations
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc

# Create the directory /etc/apt/keyrings with specific permissions (755: owner can read/write/execute; group/others can read/execute)
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings

# Download the Docker GPG key and save it to /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc. This key is used to verify the integrity of Docker packages.
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Ensure the Docker GPG key file has read permissions for all users
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the Docker repository to the system's APT sources list, specifying the architecture and signing key
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# Update the package list to include the Docker packages from the newly added repository
sudo apt-get update

# Install Docker Engine, CLI, container runtime, and necessary plugins (Buildx and Compose)
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

# Run a test Docker container to verify that Docker is installed and functioning correctly
sudo docker run hello-world

# Create the 'docker' group, which allows users in this group to run Docker commands without sudo
sudo groupadd docker

# Add the current user to the 'docker' group to enable running Docker commands without sudo
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Reboot the system to apply group changes
sudo reboot

# After reboot, run the test Docker container again to verify that the current user can run Docker commands without sudo
docker run hello-world
```
A successful installation of Docker would have this output:
```plaintext
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (arm64v8)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

## Download and Install OpenLane
Download OpenLane from GitHub:

These steps will download and build OpenLane and sky130 PDK. Finally, it will run a ~5 minute test of `spm` design that verifies that the flow and the PDK were properly installed. If you are planning to use another PDK, then you need to follow the PDK installation guide for that specific PDK.
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane.git
cd OpenLane/
make
make test
```
Successful test will output the following line:
```
Basic test passed
```
<img src="images/Make_Test.png" alt="Make_Test" width="20%"/>

## Viewing Test Design Outputs
Open the final layout using KLayout. This will open the window of KLayout in editing mode -e with sky130 technology.
```bash
# Enter a Docker session:
make mount

# Open the spm.gds using KLayout with sky130 PDK
klayout -e -nn $PDK_ROOT/sky130A/libs.tech/klayout/tech/sky130A.lyt \
   -l $PDK_ROOT/sky130A/libs.tech/klayout/tech/sky130A.lyp \
   ./designs/spm/runs/openlane_test/results/final/gds/spm.gds
```
<img src="images/Test_GDS.png" alt="Test_GDS" width="100%"/>

## Leave the Docker
```bash
exit
```

## Step 1. Starting the OpenLane Environment
OpenLane uses Docker to create a reproducible environment for your projects. You donâ€™t need any extra steps to run the Docker image, as the Makefile already takes care of it. Just run the following commands to enter the OpenLane environment:
```bash
cd ~/OpenLane/
make mount
```
Your terminal environment should now switch to the OpenLane Container:

<img src="images/OpenLane_Container.png" alt="OpenLane_Container" width="20%"/>

## Step 2. Running the flow
The entry point for OpenLane is the `./flow.tcl` script.

For various arguments to this script, checkout the [Docs](https://openlane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/openlane_commands.html#general-commands)
```bash
# Run in Interactive mode
./flow.tcl -interactive
```
The terminal prompt should now change to Tcl Console represeted by `%` symbol:

<img src="images/Flow_Tcl_Console.png" alt="Flow_Tcl_Console" width="20%"/>

# Step 3. Setup Target Package
```bash
# Specify OpenLane Package Version
package require openlane 0.9
```
# Step 4. Specify the Target Design
Specify the design folder. A design folder should contain a `config.tcl` or `config.json` file defining the design parameters. If the folder is not found, the `./designs` directory is searched for said file.

In our case, we will be working on `picorv32a` already present in the `~/Openlane/designs` directory.
```bash
prep -design picorv32a
```
Output:

<img src="images/Prep_Design_Tcl.png" alt="Prep_Design_Tcl" width="20%"/>

## Prep Design Output Explanation

The output of the `prep -design picorv32a` command in OpenLane is providing detailed information about the preparation of the design environment for the physical design flow of the `picorv32a` design. 

Note: this output may vary according to the Github commit version of OpenLane you are using.

### 1. `[INFO]: Using configuration in 'designs/picorv32a/config.tcl'...`
- **Explanation**: This message indicates that OpenLane is using the configuration file located at `designs/picorv32a/config.tcl`. This file contains specific settings and parameters that guide the design flow for the `picorv32a` design.

### 2. `[INFO]: Process Design Kit: sky130A`
- **Explanation**: The Process Design Kit (PDK) being used is `sky130A`. A PDK includes technology-specific information like design rules, process parameters, and standard cell libraries. `sky130A` refers to the SkyWater 130nm process technology.

### 3. `[INFO]: PDK Root: /home/parallels/.volare`
- **Explanation**: The root directory for the PDK is located at `/home/parallels/.volare`. This is where the PDK files and related data are stored. OpenLane accesses these files for process-specific information during the flow.

### 4. `[INFO]: Standard Cell Library: sky130_fd_sc_hd`
- **Explanation**: The standard cell library being used is `sky130_fd_sc_hd`. This library contains the logic cells (like gates, flip-flops) that are used to build the design. `hd` typically stands for high-density, indicating a library optimized for area.

### 5. `[INFO]: Optimization Standard Cell Library: sky130_fd_sc_hd`
- **Explanation**: The same `sky130_fd_sc_hd` library is also being used for optimization purposes. Optimization in physical design often involves choosing the best cells to meet timing, power, and area requirements.

### 6. `[INFO]: Run Directory: /openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/RUN_2024.08.25_18.36.22`
- **Explanation**: The directory where all the files and results of this specific run will be stored is `/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/RUN_2024.08.25_18.46.43`. This directory is automatically created with a timestamp (`2024.08.25_18.46.43`) to differentiate between different runs.

### 7. `[WARNING]: SYNTH_MAX_FANOUT is now deprecated; use MAX_FANOUT_CONSTRAINT instead.`
- **Explanation**: This warning indicates that the `SYNTH_MAX_FANOUT` parameter is no longer in use. Users are recommended to use the `MAX_FANOUT_CONSTRAINT` parameter instead for controlling the maximum fanout during synthesis.

### 8. `[INFO]: Saving runtime environment...`
- **Explanation**: OpenLane saves the current runtime environment, including all relevant settings and environment variables. This helps in ensuring reproducibility and debugging if needed.

### 9. `[INFO]: Preparing LEF files for the nom corner...`
- **Explanation**: LEF (Library Exchange Format) files are being prepared for the "nom" (nominal) corner. The "nom" corner represents typical process, voltage, and temperature conditions. LEF files contain information about the physical layout of the cells.

### 10. `[INFO]: Preparing LEF files for the min corner...`
- **Explanation**: LEF files are also being prepared for the "min" corner, which represents the slowest or least favorable process, voltage, and temperature conditions. This is important for ensuring the design meets timing and functionality under worst-case scenarios.

### 11. `[INFO]: Preparing LEF files for the max corner...`
- **Explanation**: Similarly, LEF files are prepared for the "max" corner, representing the fastest or most favorable conditions. This helps in verifying that the design does not violate timing or other constraints under best-case scenarios.

### 12. `[WARNING]: PNR_SDC_FILE is not set. It is recommended to write a custom SDC file for the design. Defaulting to BASE_SDC_FILE`
- **Explanation**: This warning indicates that the `PNR_SDC_FILE` (which specifies timing constraints for Place and Route) is not set. OpenLane will default to using the `BASE_SDC_FILE`, but it is recommended to create a custom SDC file tailored to the specific design to ensure better timing optimization during the Place and Route phase.

### 14. `[WARNING]: SIGNOFF_SDC_FILE is not set. It is recommended to write a custom SDC file for the design. Defaulting to BASE_SDC_FILE`
- **Explanation**: Similar to the previous warning, this message indicates that the `SIGNOFF_SDC_FILE` (which is used for final timing sign-off) is not set. Again, OpenLane defaults to the `BASE_SDC_FILE`, but using a custom SDC file is recommended for accurate final timing verification.

# RTL2GDS Flow

## 1. Synthesis
Runs `yosys` synthesis on the current design as well as `OpenSTA` timing analysis on the generated netlist. The logs are produced under `/<run_path>/logs/synthesis/`, the timing reports are under `/<run_path>/reports/synthesis/`, and the synthesized netlist under `/<run_path>/results/synthesis/`.
```bash
run_synthesis
```
<img src="images/Run_Synthesis_Tcl.png" alt="Run_Synthesis_Tcl" width="20%"/>

Open another Terminal tab/window to analyse the synthesis report.

```bash
# Replace `<run_path>` with your directory path
# Example: ~/OpenLane/designs/picorv32a/runs/RUN_2024.08.25_18.46.43
cd <run_path>/reports/synthesis/

# List all files
ll
```
### Synthesis Report: 

<img src="images/Synthesis_Directory.png" alt="Synthesis_Directory" width="20%"/>

After running the `run_synthesis` command in OpenLane, several report files are generated to provide detailed information about the synthesis process, including area usage, statistics, and specific checks. Here's an explanation of each of these report files:

### 1. `1-synthesis.AREA_0.chk.rpt`
This file is a check report (`chk.rpt`) related to the area estimation during synthesis. The report typically includes checks and validations performed to ensure that the area usage (in terms of cell count and overall footprint) meets the design requirements or constraints. It may contain warnings or errors if any area-related issues are detected, such as exceeding the area budget.

### 2. `1-synthesis_pre.stat`
The `1-synthesis_pre.stat` file contains pre-synthesis statistics. This report captures the state of the design before the synthesis process begins, including information about the design's logic, flip-flops, and other elements before they are optimized and mapped to standard cells. This file is useful for comparing the design before and after synthesis to understand the impact of the synthesis process.

### 3. `1-synthesis.AREA_0.stat.rpt`
This file is a detailed area report generated after synthesis. It includes statistics on the area occupied by the synthesized design, broken down by different categories, such as standard cells, combinational logic, and sequential elements (like flip-flops). The report provides a summary of how much area each part of the design consumes, helping to analyze and optimize area utilization.

### 4. `1-synthesis_pre_synth.chk.rpt`
The `1-synthesis_pre_synth.chk.rpt` is a check report generated before the actual synthesis begins. It contains checks related to the design's integrity, constraints, and potential issues that could affect synthesis. This report helps in identifying any problems that need to be addressed before running the synthesis, such as constraint violations or design rule checks.

### 5. `1-synthesis_dff.stat`
This report file, `1-synthesis_dff.stat`, focuses on the statistics of the flip-flops (`DFF` stands for D Flip-Flop) used in the design. It provides information on the number and types of flip-flops present in the synthesized design, including details about their distribution and utilization. This report is particularly important for understanding the design's sequential logic and its impact on overall area and timing.

---

These files collectively provide a comprehensive view of the synthesis process, from pre-synthesis conditions to post-synthesis area utilization and flip-flop statistics. They are essential for analyzing the effectiveness of the synthesis, identifying potential issues, and optimizing the design for better performance, area, and power efficiency.

### Flip Flop Ratio
- One of the first tasks after synthesis is to calculate the Flop Ratio. 
- The Flop Ratio is a metric used to evaluate the utilization of flip-flops in your design.
- It is calculated as the ratio of the number of D flip-flops to the total number of cells in the design.
- These details can be found in the generated `1-synthesis.AREA_0.stat.rpt` file.

```bash
# Extract and store the number of cells
num_cells=$(grep -E 'Number of cells:' 1-synthesis.AREA_0.stat.rpt | awk '{print $NF}')

# Extract and store the number of D Flip-Flops
num_dff=$(grep 'sky130_fd_sc_hd__dfxtp_' 1-synthesis.AREA_0.stat.rpt | awk '{print $2}')

# Calculate the Flip-Flop Ratio in percentage
flip_flop_ratio=$(echo "scale=2; $num_dff / $num_cells * 100" | bc)

# Output the results
echo "Number of Cells: $num_cells"
echo "Number of D Flip-Flops: $num_dff"
echo "Flip-Flop Ratio: $flip_flop_ratio%"
```

#### Explanation of the above termainal commands
<details>
    <summary>Expand or Collapse</summary>
```bash
# Extract and store the number of cells
num_cells=$(grep -E 'Number of cells:' 1-synthesis.AREA_0.stat.rpt | awk '{print $NF}')
```

- **`grep -E 'Number of cells:' 1-synthesis.AREA_0.stat.rpt`**: 
  - `grep -E` searches the file `1-synthesis.AREA_0.stat.rpt` for the line containing the text `Number of cells:`.
  - `-E` allows for extended regular expressions, but in this case, it's just matching a simple string.
  
- **`awk '{print $NF}'`**: 
  - `awk` is a text processing tool.
  - `{print $NF}` tells `awk` to print the last field (`NF` stands for "Number of Fields") of the line matched by `grep`.
  - This extracts the number of cells from the line.
  
- **`num_cells=$(...)`**:
  - The result of the `grep` and `awk` commands is stored in the variable `num_cells`.
  - `$(...)` is command substitution, meaning the output of the command inside the parentheses is assigned to `num_cells`.

```bash
# Extract and store the number of D Flip-Flops
num_dff=$(grep 'sky130_fd_sc_hd__dfxtp_' 1-synthesis.AREA_0.stat.rpt | awk '{print $2}')
```

- **`grep 'sky130_fd_sc_hd__dfxtp_' 1-synthesis.AREA_0.stat.rpt`**:
  - `grep` searches the file `1-synthesis.AREA_0.stat.rpt` for the line containing the specific cell name `sky130_fd_sc_hd__dfxtp_`.
  - This cell name represents the D Flip-Flops in the design.

- **`awk '{print $2}'`**:
  - This tells `awk` to print the second field of the matched line.
  - The second field contains the number of D Flip-Flops.

- **`num_dff=$(...)`**:
  - The number of D Flip-Flops is stored in the variable `num_dff`.

```bash
# Calculate the Flip-Flop Ratio in percentage
flip_flop_ratio=$(echo "scale=2; $num_dff / $num_cells * 100" | bc)
```

- **`echo "scale=2; $num_dff / $num_cells * 100"`**:
  - `echo` outputs the string `"scale=2; $num_dff / $num_cells * 100"`.
  - `scale=2` sets the precision to 2 decimal places for the calculation.
  - `$num_dff / $num_cells * 100` calculates the ratio of D Flip-Flops to total cells and multiplies by 100 to get a percentage.

- **`| bc`**:
  - The output of `echo` is piped to `bc`, a command-line calculator that can handle floating-point arithmetic.
  - `bc` evaluates the expression and returns the result.

- **`flip_flop_ratio=$(...)`**:
  - The result of the `bc` calculation is stored in the variable `flip_flop_ratio`.

```bash
# Output the results
echo "Number of Cells: $num_cells"
echo "Number of D Flip-Flops: $num_dff"
echo "Flip-Flop Ratio: $flip_flop_ratio%"
```

- **`echo "Number of Cells: $num_cells"`**:
  - Prints the total number of cells.

- **`echo "Number of D Flip-Flops: $num_dff"`**:
  - Prints the number of D Flip-Flops.

- **`echo "Flip-Flop Ratio: $flip_flop_ratio%"`**:
  - Prints the Flip-Flop Ratio as a percentage.

These lines provide a detailed output of the synthesis report, showing the number of cells, the number of D Flip-Flops, and the calculated Flip-Flop Ratio.
</details>

### Flip Flop Ratio Output
```
Number of Cells: 16558
Number of D Flip-Flops: 1613
Flip-Flop Ratio: 9.00%
```

### Synthesis Results
After running the synthesis process in OpenLane, two key files are typically generated in the `results/synthesis` folder:

```bash
# Replace `<run_path>` with your directory path
# Example: ~/OpenLane/designs/picorv32a/runs/RUN_2024.08.25_18.46.43
cd <run_path>/results/synthesis/

# List all files
ll
```

#### 1. `picorv32a.sdf` (Standard Delay Format File)

**Purpose:**
- The `picorv32a.sdf` file is a **Standard Delay Format (SDF)** file. It contains timing information extracted from the synthesized design, such as delays for gates, interconnects, and setup/hold times for flip-flops.
- SDF files are used in timing simulations to ensure that the synthesized design meets timing constraints.

**Key Contents:**
- **Delays:** Specifies the propagation delay of signals through gates and interconnects. Delays are often specified for different conditions like minimum, typical, and maximum values.
- **Setup/Hold Times:** Defines the setup and hold times for flip-flops and other sequential elements.
- **Timing Checks:** Includes timing checks that validate if the circuit operates correctly under specified timing constraints.

**Usage:**
- This file is used during post-synthesis and post-layout simulations. By back-annotating the delays in the netlist with the information in the SDF file, a more accurate simulation of the circuit's timing behavior can be achieved.
- Tools like ModelSim, VCS, OpenSTA(in our case) or other simulation tools can use the SDF file to simulate the timing of the synthesized design, ensuring that it will function correctly at the specified clock speed in the final implementation.

#### 2. `picorv32a.v` (Gate-Level Netlist)

**Purpose:**
- The `picorv32a.v` file is the **gate-level netlist** in Verilog format. It represents the synthesized version of the design, where high-level RTL (Register Transfer Level) code has been mapped to specific logic gates and standard cells provided by the technology library (in this case, the `sky130_fd_sc_hd` standard cells).

**Key Contents:**
- **Instances of Standard Cells:** The netlist contains instances of logic gates, flip-flops, multiplexers, etc., mapped from the RTL design to the actual cells in the standard cell library.
- **Wires and Nets:** It shows how the cells are connected via wires or nets.
- **Ports:** Input, output, and bidirectional ports of the design, as defined in the original RTL, are maintained in the gate-level netlist.

**Usage:**
- The gate-level netlist is used in post-synthesis simulations and further stages of the design flow, such as place-and-route (PnR).
- It is a crucial file for verifying that the synthesized design behaves as expected and meets the required specifications before proceeding to physical design steps.
- This file is also useful for generating final layouts and for preparing for the tape-out of the design.

### Synthesised Netlist
The ABC has done all the mappings!
```bash
less picorv32a.v
```
<img src="images/Synthesised_Netlist.png" alt="Synthesised_Netlist" width="20%"/>

To quit the `less` window, press `q`

### OpenSTA Timing Report
After running the synthesis process in OpenLane, the timing reports are generated in `logs/timimg` folder:

```bash
# Replace `<run_path>` with your directory path
# Example: ~/OpenLane/designs/picorv32a/runs/RUN_2024.08.25_18.46.43
cd <run_path>/logs/synthesis/

# List all files
ls

# View `2-sta.log` file as mentioned in the output of `run_synthesis` command
